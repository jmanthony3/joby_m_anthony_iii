Official supporters in this month: - William Ripley - Petar Djurkovic - Mayra Sharif - Dov Bulka  - Lukas M\"uhrke - Khan El - Marco Molinari  - Andrey Kamchatnikov  - Benjamin Bellick  - Sarah Kim  This video is about the QR decomposition for square matrices. I show the algorithm with the help of an example.  I hope that this helps students, pupils and others. \#LinearAlgebra (This explanation fits to lectures for students in their first year of study: Mathematics for physicists, Mathematics for the natural science, Mathematics for engineers and so on)}
